_Listed Above are the three environments that I used for working through this project_

_Here is some of that assembly that was mentioned before. I decided that if I were to simplify or change anything I's much rather interact with the rregisters through a higher-level language_
_Another thing to note, despite TempleOS' scheduler using a round-robin algorithm, the utilization would still not be close to ideal with modern components. Even after changing some kernel files in display._
